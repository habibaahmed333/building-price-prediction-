This project predicts house prices using regression models. It includes data preprocessing (imputation, outlier handling, feature encoding), exploratory analysis (correlation, visualizations), and modeling with Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression. Models are evaluated using MSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores, optimizing accuracy and feature importance.
